This is my Week 04 HiLo Project. It is a simple game of chance. The program starts off by presenting a number from 1 to 13 to the user, and asks them if the next one
in the sequence will be higher or lower. The user may then answer with 'h' or 'l', which the program will take into consideration upon revealing the next number within
the same array as before. From there, it will calculate if the user was correct in their guess, and will award 100 points to their starting total of 300 points if they
are correct, or will deduct 75 points if they are wrong. The game will then as the player if they desire to play again, at which point they may end the game by selecting
'n'. The game may also end if the player reduces their point total to 0.
